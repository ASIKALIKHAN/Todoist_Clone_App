# Credits

I learned Android development from sir Paulo Dichone(https://github.com/pdichone).
🙆‍♂️ ✔ As there are no ways where I can submit the assignment , here I submitted it with some added features:
 
☑ Added Notification and alarm for the todoister clone.(App only for under API 32)

☑ Added User control over alert options: Notification / alarm ( User can turn On/Off in setting Screen).

☑ Added User can change wallpaper in the app (Using spinner select a wallpaper and hit save changes to apply).

☑ Used sharedpreference for saving the settings to the todoist clone.
